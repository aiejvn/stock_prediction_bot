Modern Stock Prediction Using DeepRL 

Goal of this project: to build a model with at least 95% accuracy (two-tailed 5% level of significance) in predicting the future price of a modern stock company at least 1 week (5 days) into the future within an acceptable confidence interval. We achieve this using an architecture similar to the Verdie Gardening AI by Electric Sheep, where we train a LSTM to predict stock prices (possibly try including class labels) and refine it for modern day stocks using Reinforcement Learning.
